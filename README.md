# Laser Shooting Target Prototype

## Description
This project is an individual embedded system prototype developed as a laser shooting target game.
The system detects laser hits using an LDR sensor and processes the input using an Arduino-based control system.
The prototype displays information through an LCD interface and controls a servo motor to create interactive target movement.
This project focuses on basic sensor input processing, actuator control, and user interaction in an embedded system environment.

## Features
- Laser hit detection using LDR sensor
- Interactive target movement using micro servo motor
- Information display using 16x2 LCD
- Button-based user control
- Simple embedded control logic

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO R3 (ATmega328P)
- 10KΩ Resistor
- 16x2 LCD
- I2C LCD Module
- Micro Servo 9g
- Mini Red Dot Laser
- Push Button Switch
- LDR Sensor
- AA Batteries
- Battery Holder
- USB Cable
- Jumper Wires

## Working Principle
The laser beam is directed toward the target area and detected by the LDR sensor.
When the laser hits the sensor, the Arduino processes the input signal and triggers system responses such as
servo motor movement and LCD display updates.
User interaction is controlled through a push button and real-time system feedback is provided through the LCD interface.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO R3
- Embedded C / Arduino Programming
- Basic electronic components
- Sensor–actuator integration

## Project Type
Individual Academic Prototype
